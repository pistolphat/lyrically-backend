- Ability to properly put in Axios requests.


## Day 1
- Brainstorm of Ideas.
- Created Models, User Stories, Wireframes.
- Started Back-End to develop Models, DB, and controllers.
- Attempts to deploy to Heroku. Errors at first, but success after debugging. Not all route requests function.

## Day 2
- Snowed In. Finished Models, Controllers, and DB. Able to push successfully via Heroku. Used POSTMAN to test various Routes and CRUD successfully.
- Tele work and communication was very difficult among team members.
- Teammates started working on Front-End React.

## Day 3
- Focused mainly on React. Ability to get Read, Update, and Delete functional. However, Git Workflow and all that git fetch, push, pull etc gave numerious problems.
- There was progress, but still alot of work to do.
- CSS additions

## Day 4
- Finalize CSS and other loose ends.
- Presentation
